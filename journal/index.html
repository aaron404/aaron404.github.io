Truthfully I finished this post about 10 months ago but wasnâ€™t happy with a couple parts of it. To be honest Iâ€™m still not 100% happy with it but no amount of rewrites will ever make that true! I think in its current state it still has a lot to offer and wraps up the story with a satisfying conclusion. I have many other projects being juggled but I think itâ€™s healthy to actually finish one every once in a while!<h2 id=2024-07-27-where-does-the-time-go>2024-07-27 - Where does the time go</h2><p>Itâ€™s been so long since my last post that the access token for my site builder elapsed! Itâ€™s been a busy summer indeed and it will probably continue to be at least for the next couple months. I have really enjoyed writing the 2nd (and 2.5th) part of my series on automated gaming with Rust and canâ€™t wait to get going on part 3 as I find the time.<h2 id=2024-06-21-blog-is-live-wrench>2024-06-21 - Blog is live! ðŸ”§</h2><p>I have been wanting to try blogging for several years now and finally took the time to do some research on the subject. For now Iâ€™ve settled on a markdown-based static site generator called Zola, featuring the <a href=https://github.com/Speyll/anemone rel=noopener target=_blank>anemone</a> theme. I plan to use this blog to document some of my hobby projects. Some of my interests you can expect to hear about are programming, computer graphics, fractals, and maybe some music. Iâ€™m kicking things off with a blog series about automating Dungeons and Diagrams, a logic puzzle minigame present in the game Last Call BBS.<p class=tagsData></main><footer><hr><div class=footContainer><div class=footLeft><p>Built with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://www.getzola.org target=_blank>Zola</a> using <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://github.com/Speyll/anemone target=_blank>anemone</a> theme.<br></div></div></footer></div>
